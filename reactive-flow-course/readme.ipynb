We favor the use of the open domain variant of cfMesh. We intend to provide scripts allowing to generate a coarse, intermediate and fine mesh. We will assume course participants to be sufficient familiar with geometry definition and mesh generation to be able to make informed use of the scripts that we provide. We intend to provide pointers on the mesh generation. "
