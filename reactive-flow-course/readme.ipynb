    "\n",
    "Welcome to this course on simulating reactive flows using OpenFoam! \n",
    "\n",
    "In typical applications, fuel and oxidizer are transported, mixed and consumed in chemical reactions. These reactions produce products and heat. The field is large and covers laminar and turbulent, stationary and transient, premixed, partially premixed and non-premixed scenarios. The fuel can be supplied in gasseous, liquid and solid form. \n",
    "\n",
    "OpenFoam is extensively used in the simulating of reactive flows. Provide here links to recent papers (both solver development and application), seminar series (Singapore, Milano-Darmstadt) and previous courses (Dacolt, Contino, Lucchini).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This course extends over three days. It is organized as follows. (more here) \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, the model complexity is gradually increased. We will cover the following four tutorial cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. laminar premixed combustion of gasseous hydrogen using XiFoam (Toro Flame + reference); extend to DLRCJH; \n",
    "2. turbulent non-premixed combustion of methane in a pilot-stabiled flame using reactingFoam (SandiaD flame + references);\n",
    "3. turbulent non-premixed of methane jet flame in co-flow with air in fluid domain coupled with heat transfer to the enclosing solid domain using chtMultiRegionFoam (reverseBurner); \n",
    "4. combustion of coal using coalChemistryFoam (kivaTest); "

    "The insertion of set convection-diffusion-reaction equations for the chemical species (YEqn) or the insertion of the transport equations for radiative heat transfer quantities (IEqn) in the S/PIMPLE causes two effects. The first effect is the increase of computational cost per iteration. The second effect is the increase of number of S/PIMPLE iterations to reach converge in case of a stationary computation or to reach meaningful statistics (e.g. typical frequency of vortex shedding).
