    "1/ Regarding the simulations \n",
    "\n",
    "   The physics of the milling is dictated by what happens in the rotor-stator gap, most obviously. Without a proper mesh convergence analysis, results obtained for the flow are not meaningful. Indeed, any change in the model coefficients (surface roughness, rotor speed, turbulence model coefficient) cannot be properly accessed without a proper (volumetric and boundary layer) meshing strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Q1: How have ideas on how to generate the mesh evolved since last time we spoke? How do you decide spatial resolution to be sufficient? \n",
    "    Q2: How much manual work does mesh generation require? What happens in case the airgap is reduced? To what extend can pre-processing be automated? \n",
    "    Q3: Could you complement your wonderful version of previous slides with information on the mesh (number of cells, mesh quality) and the solver used (e.g. residual convergence of the simulations, CPU time)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2/ Regarding the hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "     The use of Mahti / Puhti might well be limiting for various reasons. I am not sure too what extend these machines allow for interactive work, to what extend you are comfortable with Linux, how fast the connection to Mahti / Puhti from Delft will be, and how comfortable the file transfer back and forth will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "      Q4: Have you used  Mahti / Puhti from your house? How has the experience been?  \n",
    "      Q5: Does the academic license of Ansys Fluent currently in use allow to run simulations on multiple nodes or multiple concurrent licenses on single nodes ? Is the license exclusively available to you?  ",
    "      Q6: Does the system administrator of Mahti / Puhti have experience in supporting OpenFoam simulations? \n",
    "      Q7: Do you have access to MacBook laptop on which you can install all software and that you can bring to Delft? A MacBook has the advantage of offering a Windows like Users experience while at the same time providing access to Linux. "
