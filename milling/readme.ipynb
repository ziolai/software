    "1. water vs. pulp (particle size distribution and particle surface tension/hardness): change in viscosity - local changes in strain and shear stress; \n",
    "2. effect to temperature and pre-heating; \n",
    "3. value of surface roughness; \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2.1: Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. in early geometry models outlet too close to main flow domain; \n",
    "2. we suggest to place sufficiently anonymous geonmetry in public domain; \n",
    "3. we sugest to revert to OpenFoam to automate workflow and to make large scale simulations (in case applicable) possible;\n",

    "\n",
    "1. mesh independent results for shear stress in the airgap (otherwise results numerics induced and thus hard to compare).  \n",

    "Note: Lab data should be used as boundary conditions in the mathematical model. "
