    "\n",
    "Numerical modeling of the milling of paper pulp using a pressure-driven rotating disk mill.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 2.1: Questions \n",
    "\n",
    "1. water vs. pulp (particle size distribution and particle surface tension/hardness): change in viscosity - local changes in strain and shear stress; \n",
    "2. effect to temperature and pre-heating; \n",
    "3. surface roughness: measured values, observed effects, parameter setting for turbulent viscosity; \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 3.1: Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. in early geometry models outlet too close to main flow domain;\n",
    "2. non-linear laminar viscosity and turbulent are expected to play complementary roles. We expect that both will need to be modeled.  \n",
    "3. we suggest to place sufficiently anonymous geometry in public domain; \n",
    "4. we suggest to revert to OpenFoam to automate workflow and to make large scale simulations (in case applicable) possible; \n",

    "\n",
    "What literature/state-of-the-art do we base our work on? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 5.1: Research Question \n",
    "\n",
    "1. mesh independent results for shear stress in the airgap (otherwise results numerics induced and thus hard to compare).  \n",
    "2. note: lab data should be used as boundary conditions in the mathematical model. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 6.1: Notes on these Notes (aka External Memorry) \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>To do: 0-directory and system/graphs</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. define case set-up in case 0-directory;\n",
    "2. define post-processing in the system/graphs file;\n",
    "3. add mass flow rate at the outlet;\n",
    "4. refine gnuplot functionality to view the shear stress in the airgap;   \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Goals: Non-Isothermal RANS Flow Simulations with Water as Newtonian Fluid</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. obtain mesh-independent results for the shear stress in the airgap. Else impossible to access whether results are due to the RANS turbulence closure model (standard k-epsilon model or otherwise) or the numerics of the discretization;   \n",
    "2. perform parameter studies to access how flow quantities of interest (the shear stress in the air gap, the outlet mass flow rate) depend on operating conditions (the angular velocity of the rotor, the surface roughess of the rotor, temperature of the fluid, viscosity of the fluid (artifically modified), the thickness of the airgap) and the geometry (outer boundaries, stent?) of the flow domain. Ask for guesses by experiments; \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>To do: Non-Isothermal RANS Flow Simulations with Water as Newtonian Fluid</b>\n",
    "1. rotating disk - option-1 (easiest? - do we require alternatives?): implement rotating disk as in the [pipeCyclic tutorial case](https://develop.openfoam.com/Development/openfoam/-/tree/master/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/pipeCyclic) using a codedFixedValue for U (assuming no-slip between disk and liquid. Compare with lid driven cavity);\n",

    "3. rotating disk - option-3: [rotorDisk](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/v2206/doc/guide-fvoptions-sources-rotor-disk.html) as alternative for setting rotating rotor - does rotorDisk allow to specify a laminar surface roughness;\n",
    "4. surface roughness of disk (1/3): laminar flow settings:  dixit <i>Laminar flow is independent of the pipe roughness since the flow is stratified and covers the roughness. It then behaves like a flow along a smooth wall.</i> (see top page 8 [Internship report](https://static.fossee.in/fossee/FOSSEE-Summer-Fellowship2022/OpenFOAM/Tinto_Report_Friction_Factor_LM.pdf)) Google Gemini gives same answer. \n",
    "5. surface roughness of disk (2/3): RANS turbulent flow settings: wall function for turbulent viscosity for rough walls. See [nutURoughWallFunction](https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/v2206/api/classFoam_1_1nutURoughWallFunctionFvPatchScalarField.html#details). How sensitve is the model to model parameters?\n",
    "6. surface roughness of disk (3/3): Should (D)DES or Wall-Modeled LES serve as alternative to RANS?  \n",
    "7. post-processing for the shear in case of solving for the shear stress (S), add visualization of the shear stress;"
