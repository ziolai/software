    "2. perform parameter studies to access how flow quantities of interest (the shear stress in the air gap, the outlet mass flow rate) depend on operating conditions (the angular velocity of the rotor, the surface roughess of the rotor, temperature of the fluid, viscosity of the fluid (artifically modified), the thickness of the airgap) and the geometry (outer boundaries, stent?) of the flow domain.
